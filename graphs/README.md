# Graphs for Parsing with Zippers

This folder contains code to generate graphs of empirically measured data for
the ICFP 2020 paper \emph{Parsing with Zippers (Functional Pearl)} by Pierce
Darragh and Michael D.~Adams.

This data is read from files named \code{cubic.csv} and
\code{all-bench-results.csv}, so those files must be created or updated before
compiling this graphs.

Once those files have been created, simply run `make`.

The graphs will then be in `graphs.pdf`.
